<p>
My name is Mauro and I have always worked with technologies. I am a husband of a fantastic woman and a father of two wonderful sons that changed my life forever. I started my professional career after serving in the Army, in 1998, i was a swimmer.<br>
At that time, ICT was only my hobby, but since then I decided to transform into my future career. I started to study many aspects of ICT, like Programming, Security and Infrastructure.<br>
  Now i work as IT Project Manager with the love of development.
